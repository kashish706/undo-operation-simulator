# Undo Operation Simulator
This project demonstrates a basic "Undo Operation Simulator" built using "HTML, CSS, JavaScript", and "C++". It mimics how text editors work — allowing you to type characters one at a time and undo them using a stack-based approach.

##  Project Structure
| File | Description |
| `index.html` | Interactive web interface for typing and undoing characters |
| `undo_simulator.cpp` | C++ implementation of the undo logic in a text-based environment |

## 🚀 Features
- 🔡 Type one character at a time (via UI)
- 🔙 Undo the last typed character
- 📦 Stack-based visual history of operations
- ✨ Responsive and clean UI
- 💻 C++ version for terminal-based simulation
